# K-Means Clustering from Scratch

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy.

# Steps
1. Import Libraries
2. Synthetic 2D dataset generation
3. K-Means algorithm implementation
4. Elbow Method for optimal K
5. Final clustering visualization

# Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

# conclusion

A synthetic 2D dataset was created and K-Means clustering was implemented from scratch using NumPy.

The Elbow Method showed that K = 3 is the optimal number of clusters.

The final clustering correctly grouped the data points and the centroids converged successfully
